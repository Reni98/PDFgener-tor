And I’ve included New Year’s stories as well, since Christmas was historically seen as a twelve-day period, beginning on December 25th and ending on January 5th, or Twelfth Night. You can read these Christmas stories online for free, print them out, or download them for free to your e-reader. Some include illustrations as well! If you prefer to listen to these Christmas stories, you’ll also find a link to the audio version, if available";
